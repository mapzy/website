                We only set one essential cookie.
                While we don't track your visitors, our mapping service provider Mapbox collects
                some anonymous data. Unfortunately, we can't disable this.
                Learn more in our <a href=\"/legal/privacy-policy\">privacy policy</a>.
                Mapzy is fully compliant with GDPR, and doesn't require you to show an
                ugly cookie pop-up.
                We host Mapzy in a data center in Frankfurt, Germany, which is powered
                by 100% renewable energy."
