- title: Simple and pretty
  description: "We've designed Mapzy so that it looks great on every device and website.
                It's also very simple to use: your customers won't get lost in a myriad of unnecessary features. Mapzy does a few things, but does them really well."
- title: No Code Required
  description: "Using the Mapzy dashboard, you can create your store finder in mere minutes without touching a line of code.
                Installing your map on your own website is also a piece of cake: just copy the displayed embed code to your website and it's live!
                Mapzy works on every website - Wordpress, Shopify, Webflow, Squarespace - anything, really."
- title: Privacy-friendly and GDPR compliant
  description: "We've buit Mapzy with privacy in mind. We only set one essential cookie, don't track your visitors and will never do.
                It's worth noting that our mapping service provider - Mapbox - collects
                some anonymous technical data, that we can not disable.
                Learn more in our <a href=\"/legal/privacy-policy\">privacy policy</a>.
                Mapzy is also fully compliant with GDPR, so you don't have to show an
                ugly cookie pop-up to your customers."
- title: Open-source and self-hostable
  description: "Mapzy's source code is fully open-source and available on
                <a href=\"https://github.com/mapzy/mapzy\">GitHub</a>.
                The managed version of Mapzy is hosted on a data center in Frankfurt, Germany, which is powered
                by 100% renewable energy. But if you'd like, you can also host it yourself for free with the same features and without any restrictions.
                If you're a developer, you're very welcome to contribute Mapzy, too!"
