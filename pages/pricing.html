    Every product feature is fully available on each plan, without any restrictions. <br>
    The only difference between the plans is how many locations you can add. You don't have to choose right now though, your plan is automatically upgraded or downgraded based on your usage.<br>
    Each plan comes with a 2-week free trial, no credit card required.
