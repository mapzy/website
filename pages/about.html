  Mapzy is created by Sagar Guptar and Can Olcer. Sag lives in Zurich, Switzerland and Can lives in Berlin, Germany. We've started Mapzy because we were missing a simple, privacy-focused and fairly priced store finder. We decided to make Mapzy open-source for two main reasons: First, anyone can host it for free on their own server without any restrictions. Second, other developers can contribute to the code and help us make it better.

    We've started Mapzy because we were missing a simple, privacy-focused and fairly-priced store finder. Every entrepreneur should be able to create a beautiful store finder — without having to code or pay big money for it — and keep their focus on their business.

  <p class="mb-4">
    Mapzy is open-source (under <a href="https://github.com/mapzy/mapzy/blob/main/LICENSE"> AGPL-3.0 License</a>). Anyone can host it for free on their own server and use the product without any restrictions. Plus, other developers can contribute to the code and help us make it better for everybody.

  Mapzy is independent and will stay that way. We're fully self-funded and are not interested in taking any venture capital money. Our goal is not to make the most sophisticated store finder there is. Our goal is to make a simple, but high-quality store finder and offer it at a fair price. It only does a few things, but it does them well.
