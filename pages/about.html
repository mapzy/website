    We've started Mapzy because we were missing a simple and fairly-priced store finder. Our goal is not to make the most sophisticated store finder there is. Our goal is to make a simple, but high-quality store finder and offer it at a fair price. Also, we are not interested in tracking you nor your visitors. Mapzy doesn't make money out of your data and will never do.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-4">
    Mapzy is open-source (under <a href="https://github.com/mapzy/mapzy/blob/main/LICENSE"> AGPL-3.0 License</a>) and self-hostable. Developers are very welcome to contribute to Mapzy and make the product better for everyone ❤️. It's also possible to host the full version of the product for free.
  </p>

  <p class="mt-4">
    Mapzy is independent, self-funded and based in Europe. Our servers are powered by 100% renewable energy.
