  <p class="mb-4">
    We've started Mapzy because we were missing a simple, privacy-focused and
    fairly-priced store finder. Every entrepreneur should be able to create a
    beautiful store finder — without having to code or pay big money for it
    — and keep their focus on their business.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Mapzy is open-source (under <a href="https://github.com/mapzy/mapzy/blob/main/LICENSE"> AGPL-3.0 License</a>). 
    Anyone can host it for free on their own server and use the product without
    any restrictions.
    Plus, other developers can contribute to the code and help us make it better for everybody.
  </p>

<p class="mb-4">
  Mapzy is independent and will stay that way.
  We're fully self-funded and are not interested in taking any venture capital money.
  Our goal is not to make the most sophisticated store finder there is.
  Our goal is to make a simple, but high-quality store finder and offer it at a fair price.
  It only does a few things, but it does them well.
</p>


  <p class="mb-4">
    Our company is based in Europe and our servers are powered by 100% renewable energy
    (thank you, DigitalOcean).
