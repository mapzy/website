Note: The following DPA applies to Mapzy Cloud only and not to self-hosted which would be hosted on your own servers and therefore the DPA isn’t needed.

Plausible Analytics is a European company and our data infrastructure is based in Germany covered by the EU's strong data privacy laws. Processing and storing data in a secure, fair, and transparent way is extremely important to us. 

This Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) is an addendum to the [Terms of Service](https://mapzy.io/terms) between Mapzy and the customer. 

If you are accepting this DPA on behalf of your customer, you warrant that: (a) you have full legal authority to bind your customer to this DPA; (b) you have read and understand this DPA; and (c) you agree, on behalf of your customer, to this DPA.

These service terms incorporate the Mapzy Data Processing Agreement” (“DPA”), when the General Data Protection regulation (“GDPR”) applies to your use of Mapzy services to process data as defined in the DPA. We protect and secure your visitor data to the high standards set out in the agreement.

## Definitions

* “You” or “customer” refers to the company or organization that signs up to use the Mapzy to create maps.

* In the course of providing the Mapzy service to customer pursuant to the agreement, Mapzy may process data uploaded by the customer.

* In this Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”), “Data Protection Legislation” means the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/279), and all other applicable laws relating to processing of visitor data and privacy that may exist in any relevant jurisdiction.

* “data controller”, “data processor”, “data subject”, “personal data” and “processing” shall be interpreted in accordance with applicable Data Protection Legislation.

* The parties agree that customer is the data controller and that Mapzy is its data processor in relation to map and location data that is processed in the course of providing the service.

## Privacy and security of your visitor data

We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. When you use our service to create maps, you will upload data about locations to Mapzy.

You entrust us with your data and we take that trust to heart. You agree that Mapzy may process your data as described in our data policy and for no other purpose. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about [who we are, how we work](https://mapzy.io/about), and keeping an open door to your feedback.

You own all right, title, and interest to your data. We obtain no rights from you to your data. We do not collect and analyze personal information from your data and use these behavioral insights to sell advertisements. When using Mapzy, you 100% own and control all of your website data. We don’t sell or share your site data to any third-parties, and we don’t abuse your visitor’s privacy.

When you embed your Mapzy map on your website, we do not track your visitors or collect any personal information. If your visitors give geolocation permission, we use the browser's built in geolocation feature to get access to the coordinates. However, this data is completely anonymous and not tied to any other data that my be used to identify any single individual.

All of the data that you upload is kept fully secured, encrypted and hosted on renewable energy powered server in Germany. This ensures that all of the website data is being covered by the European Union’s strict laws on data privacy. Your visitor data never leaves the EU.

Mapzy is fully open source software which means that our source code is available and accessible on GitHub so anyone can check it out and audit it. You can read it, inspect it and review it to understand how it works and to ensure it keeps the data private and secure. This gives you and everyone else full transparency on how we handle your data. It is this transparency and openness that means that open source products can be more trustworthy than proprietary and closed source products.

The group of data subjects affected by the processing of their data under this agreement includes end-users of the controller’s websites which make use of the service provided by the processor.

You can find more information about our processing of your data in our publicly available [data policy](https://mapzy.io/legal/data-policy).

Mapzy will only process data in accordance with the agreement.

* We do work with sub-processors. We've listed links to our current sub-processors in our [privacy policy](https://mapzy.io/privacy). With each vendor, we assess their commitment to privacy and we sign a data processing agreement with them that include the controller-processor Standard Contractual Clauses. Any such subcontractors will be permitted to process data only to deliver the services Mapzy has retained them to provide, and they shall be prohibited from using data for any other purpose. 

* If Mapzy becomes aware of any accidental, unauthorised or unlawful security breach, destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of the personal data that is processed by Mapzy in the course of providing the service, it shall without undue delay (not later than 48 hours after having become aware of it), notify customer by email and provide customer with a description of the incident as well as periodic updates to information about the incident, including its impact on customer content. Mapzy shall additionally take action to investigate the incident and reasonably prevent or mitigate the effects of the incident.

* Mapzy shall not on its own authority rectify, erase or restrict the processing of visitor data that is being processed on behalf of the controller (unless this is required by law or the Processor Terms of Service), but shall only do so on documented instructions from the controller and in accordance to the data retention rules associated to the controller subscription plan.

## How we handle delete instructions

You can choose to delete your account and delete your maps and locations data at any time. We provide simple no-questions-asked deletion links. 

All your stats will be permanently deleted immediately when you delete your Mapzy account or when you delete your maps and locations. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted.
