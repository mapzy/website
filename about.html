    Mapzy is created by Sagar Guptar and Can Olcer. Sag lives in Zurich, Switzerland and Can lives in Berlin, Germany. We've started Mapzy because we were missing a simple, privacy-focused and fairly priced store finder. We decided to make Mapzy open-source for two main reasons: First, anyone can host it for free on their own server without any restrictions. Second, other developers can contribute to the code and help us make it better.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Mapzy is independent and will stay that way. We're fully self-funded and are not interested in taking any venture capital money. Our goal is not to make the most sophisticated store finder there is. Our goal is to make a simple, but high-quality store finder and offer it at a fair price. It only does a few things, but it does them well.

    The company is based in Germany and our data center is in Frankfurt and powered by 100% renewable energy (we're using DigitalOcean).
